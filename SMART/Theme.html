In radio engineering, an antenna (American English) or aerial (British English) is the interface
between radio waves propagating through space and electric currents moving in metal conductors,
used with a transmitter or receiver.
[1]
In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric
current to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as
electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of a
radio wave in order to produce an electric current at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be
amplified. Antennas are essential components of all radio equipment.
[2]
An antenna is an array of conductors (elements), electrically connected to the receiver or
transmitter. Antennas can be designed to transmit and receive radio waves in all horizontal
directions equally (omnidirectional antennas), or preferentially in a particular direction (directional,
or high-gain, or "beam" antennas). An antenna may include components not connected to the
transmitter, parabolic reflectors, horns, or parasitic elements, which serve to direct the radio waves
into a beam or other desired radiation pattern. Strong directivity and good efficiency when
transmitting are hard to achieve with antennas with dimensions that are much smaller than a half
wavelength
