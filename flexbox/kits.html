            <p class="main2">The applicability of the concept of the transfer function is limited to linear, time-invariant, 
                differential equation systems. The transfer function approach, however, is extensively used in 
                the analysis and designs of such systems are as follows. 
                <ol class="ol"> 
                 <li>The transfer function of a system is a mathematical model in that it is an operational 
                method of expressing the differential equation that relates the output variable to the input 
                variable.</li>
                <li>The transfer function is a property of a system itself, independent of the magnitude and 
                nature of the input or driving function.</li> 
                <li>The transfer function includes the units necessary to relate the input to the output; 
                however, it does not provide any information concerning the physical structure of the 
                system. (The transfer functions of many physically different systems can be identical.)</li> 
                <li>If the transfer function of a system is known, the output or response can be studied for 
                various forms of inputs with a view toward understanding the nature of the system.</li> 
                <li> the transfer function of a system is unknown, it may be established experimentally by 
                introducing known inputs and studying the output of the system. Once established,a 
                transfer function gives a full description of the dynamic characteristics of the system, as 
                distinct from its physical description.</li>
