    The arrows in this diagram indicate the direction in which data or control signals are flowing. 
    The larger arrows indicate a group of parallel lines representing a data word, an instruction,
    or an address; the smaller arrows represent control signals, which are usually only one or a few signal lines.
     The circled numbers next to each arrow will be referred to in the following descriptions of each unit.

     The memory also serves as temporary storage of the results of operations performed by the ALU (arrow in Fig. 1.1).
