        Provide adequate illumination level according to the activity of the area for example bed room,
            kitchen so on.  
        2. Provide sufficient uniform distribution of light overall the working plane. A very good uniformity ratio
        according to European specification is UR ≥ 0.5
        3. Avoid glare and hard shadows because these cause fatigue and lack of concentration of persons
        4. Discriminate between different colors as well as the degree of color which mean color rendering index
        What is color rendering index ?
        This is a system that measure the ability of light source to accurately produce the color of an object.
